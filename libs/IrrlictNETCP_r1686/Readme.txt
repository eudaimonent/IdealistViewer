I Introduction
=============================================================================

Here is provided the SDK (Software Development Kit) for the library
"Irrlicht .NET CP".
This library provides a complete, cross-platform and easy-to-use .NET wrapper
for the Irrlicht Engine by Nikolaus Gebhardt (http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net)

This library IS NOT PART OF THE OFFICIAL IRRLICHT SDK.


=============================================================================
II Requirements
=============================================================================

On Microsoft Windows, you need the .NET official framework 2.0
(the wrapper can be compiled under version 1.1 but the binaries provided
are built under .NET 2) that can be found here :

On Linux or other Operating Systems, you need the last version 
of the Mono Project (at least the 1.16) that can be downloaded on :

IV Use the SDK
=============================================================================

If you want to try the examples, navigate to the /bin/Release directory
and start the three examples executables (simply double click on Windows
and start with "mono <name of the file>.exe" on other OS).

If you want to use the wrapper, you need to add a reference to 
/bin/Release/Irrlicht.NET.dll
on your project and copy "IrrlichtW.dll", "Irrlicht.dll" (both for Windows)
and "libIrrlichtW.so" (for Linux) on your project's directory.
